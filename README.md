# [Key_Blogger](https://key-blogger.netlify.app/)

Key_Blogger is a blogging app.  It was built to make it simple and easy to start your own blog.

On the site, all current blogs are available to read without creating a profile or signing in to an account. In order to make your own blog, you must create your own profile by simply providing at least a username and password.  This profile is used to keep track of your content and not allow other users to edit/delete it.  After creating a profile or signing in, you are free to create as many different blogs as you want.  Once a blog is made, you can start adding posts to it.  You can edit and delete your posts, as long you are logged in.

I built my own RESTful API for this app.  It was used to get/add/delete/edit blogs/blog posts.  The code can be found [here](https://github.com/colts18seth/Cap_2_backend).

The front-end for Key_Blogger was built using React.  Redux was used to hold state.  Key_Blogger was deployed with Netlify.
